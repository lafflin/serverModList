## Fabric

- If you have already installed Fabric, skip this step

1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. After installing, open up file explorer and run Fabric
3. When it asks to install, make sure you select the version you install to be **1.19** and on **CLIENT SIDE**
4. Boom you installed Fabric good job

## Fresh Install

- Thanks to a historic discovery by Dominic, the download process no longer requires you to click ~~30~~ 54 links!
- All you have to do is download from this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ethi-jyXfPoVZaotmY_CTBDhsADzofGc?usp=sharing)
  - To download, highlight all of the mods by in the google drive by either clicking and dragging over them or Ctrl+A, then right click and download.
  - You could download it straight to your download folder, or if you want to keep everything clean, make a new folder on your desktop and download it there

## Installation

Once you have everything downloaded,

1. Click the windows button, and type **_%appdata%_**, then click enter
2. This should open File explorer, and you should see a folder called ".minecraft"
3. Inside of there, you should see a mods folder, open it. if you **DO NOT** see a mods folder, go ahead and create it by right clicking and creating it. Call the folder "mods" **NOTHING ELSE**
4. Put every mod you downloaded into this folder now.
5. Finally, try to run Minecraft and hope

## Patches

**NO CURRENTLY AVAILABLE PATCHES**

- The main install is the most updated version, and cause no one else has been updating, it would be best to do a fresh install.

## Future Development

- Will work on adding bukkit in the future
- If there are any mods you would like to be added let me know, I will look into it and see if it is possible.
