## Fabric

- If you have already installed Fabric, skip this step

1. Install [Fabric](https://fabricmc.net/use/installer/)
2. After installing, open up file explorer and run Fabric
3. When it asks to install, make sure you select the version you install to be **1.19** and on **CLIENT SIDE**
4. Boom you installed Fabric good job

## Fresh Install

- Thanks to a historic discovery by Dominic, the download process no longer requires you to click ~~30~~ 54 links!
- All you have to do is download from this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ethi-jyXfPoVZaotmY_CTBDhsADzofGc?usp=sharing)
  - To download, highlight all of the mods by in the google drive by either clicking and dragging over them or Ctrl+A, then right click and download.
  - You could download it straight to your download folder, or if you want to keep everything clean, make a new folder on your desktop and download it there

## Installation

Once you have everything downloaded,

1. Click the windows button, and type **_%appdata%_**, then click enter
2. This should open File explorer, and you should see a folder called ".minecraft"
3. Inside of there, you should see a mods folder, open it. if you **DO NOT** see a mods folder, go ahead and create it by right clicking and creating it. Call the folder "mods" **NOTHING ELSE**
4. Put every mod you downloaded into this folder now.
   - _Recommended_ that when you put the mods in the mods folder from your downloads, drag and drop the files instead of copy and pasting them to save a bit of space on your computer.
5. Finally, try to run Minecraft and hope

## Common Issues

- Allocate more RAM to you game. Here's a [Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/how-to-allocate-more-ram-to-minecraft) article to show you how to give Minecraft more RAM if you do not know how to. If you have 16gb, I recommend 8gb allocated.

## Patches

- Patch 1.2

  - adds a large swath of mods, some of which being When Dungeons Arise, Flight Rings, Luggage, and a whole bunch of other smaller decorative and performance mods.

  - Notes:

    - Iris has been added to the main mod list, when you install this patch, you WILL install IRIS. if you already have Iris installed, make sure to not use the new file for Iris. "If it ain't broke don't fix it."
    - Sodium is still version 4.2 in this install. This is because it works with this version of Iris, upon switching it broken my game. "If it ain't broke don't fix it."
    - UNFORTUNATELY, Twilight Forest is still on version 1.18.2 for Fabric, while Forge is at 1.19. I assume that the update is coming soon, and it will be added in a future update.

## Future Development

- Will work on adding bukkit in the future
- Looking to maybe add some magic mods in the future, could be cool if they aren't too wild.
- If there are any mods you would like to be added let me know, I will look into it and see if it is possible.
